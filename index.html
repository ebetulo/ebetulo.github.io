      <h1>Paintings </h1>
      <p> The Dutch painter produced a large number of paintings <strong><em>(over 300 in total) </em></strong>but many works that were attributed to the artist for centuries are now disputed because his many followers and imitators created nearly perfect copies of his style. Listed below are 5 most famous and most admired Rembrandt's paintings.         </p>

      <h3> The Night Watch </h3>
      <p>Without a doubt the most famous of all Rembrandt’s paintings, The Night Watch is a group portrait of the militia company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburgh (in the center). With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd: the two men in the center (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the woman in the centre-left background carrying a chicken. During relocation in the 18th century, the most famous Rembrandt’s painting was trimmed, most notably on the left side which resulted in the loss of some characters but it also changed the composition of the painting by making the lightly clothed girl and Lieutenant the dominant figures of the scene.

       <h3> The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp </h3>
       <p>In the work, Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is pictured explaining the musculature of the arm to medical professionals. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid commissions to be included in the painting. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner Rembrandt. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogramme RHL (Rembrandt Harmenszoon of Leiden), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.

      <h3> The Sampling Officials </h3>
      <p>Also referred to as the Syndics of the Drapers’ Guild, this painting (completed in 1662) is a group portrait of the syndics of the Amsterdam Drapers Guild whose job was to evaluate the quality of fabric offered by weavers to the guild members. The exception is the man wearing calotte in the back who is a servant. The painting was commissioned by the Amsterdam Drapers Guild for their guild hall that housed it until the early 1770s.

      <h3> Bathsheba at Her Bath </h3>
      <p>The Bathsheba at Her Bath depicts Bathsheba, wife of Uriah the Hittite at the moment she was seen by King David from the roof of his palace. According to the Biblical story, David had her then brought to him to sleep with her. Since she became pregnant, David recalled her husband from the army, hoping that he would sleep with his wife and think that he is the father of the child. But because Uriah didn’t consume his marriage, the King sent him to sure death by ordering his general to place him in the front lines. After Uriah’s death, David married the widowed Bathsheba.

      <h3> Danaë </h3>
      <p>Danaë isn’t only one of Rembrandt’s best nude paintings but one of the greatest masterpieces of the celebrated Dutch artist. Just like the painting’s title suggests, it depicts Danaë, the mother of the ancient Greek mythological hero Perseus. The life-sized depiction of Danaë is thought to show her welcoming Zeus who came to her in the form of golden rain. In the 1770s, the painting was bought by Catherine II of Russia and has been housed in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg ever since.

    <h1>Rembrandt's House Museum</h1>
      <p>The Rembrandt House Museum tells the story of the multi-faceted Rembrandt. He is known above all as an artist, the maker of dozens of self-portraits, intriguing tronies, compelling history paintings and convincing portraits. But Rembrandt was much more than a talented painter, etcher and draughtsman. In the museum you will encounter Rembrandt the man, the teacher, the collector, the entrepreneur and the Amsterdammer. <a href="https://www.rembrandthuis.nl/?lang=en">Come and meet him in his own home!</a>
